## Summary of Analysis

A review was conducted of high-school student (years 9 through to 12) scores in math and reading test. The analysis endeavours to assess the performance of local government area (LGA) schools along dimensions of budget, size and type (government or independent establishment). 

The data analysed covered 15 schools with results from 39,170 studentâ€™s tests. Total LGA school budget was $24,649,428 for the period.

## Conclusions from Analysis

-	Budget per student is not a determinant of student performance. Overall passing scores (math and reading score of 50% or above) at schools with the highest expenditure (the $645-680 per student spend bracket) at 66.76% was lower than that of all other spend brackets. Highest overall performance, at 79.88% passing score, was achieved at schools in the second lowest expenditure range (the $585-630 per student spend bracket).

-	However, smaller schools show better performance than larger one. A significant improved overall passing score of 79.07% was observed in schools with less than 1,000 students. The lowest passing score of 70.29% was achieved by students in the largest schools, those with between 2,000 and 5,000 students.

-	Independent schools show better performance than government ran establishments with overall passing average scores of 76.97% and 70.70% respectively.

From the data analysed we conclude that the quality and structure of educational programs is a greater determinant of student performance than the amount of resources applied towards delivering the eductional programs. 

However, further analysis is recommended to assess whether variables such as student socio-economic circumstance correlate with school size and school type and can help to better target improvements to the educational programs within the LGA.
